# Welcome to Vngle's CMS
# Getting started with our React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Follow these steps to launch the App

In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`

This will make sure you have installed all the necessary packages needed to run the App smoothly

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
You should see a page load up autumatically.\
If the page doesn't load up, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your local browser.

The page will refresh when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
